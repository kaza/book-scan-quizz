        <h1>About AI-Quizzer</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Welcome to AI-Quizzer, an innovative learning application that harnesses the power of Google's Gemini AI to
        transform the way you study and learn. Our mission is to create an intelligent, adaptive, and engaging learning
        experience that caters to diverse learning styles and needs.</p>

    <div class="standout">
        <p>AI-Quizzer was inspired by observations in Austria of the challenges faced by immigrants and refugees from
            various regions affected by conflicts and crises. As educational systems, including Austria's, strive to
            provide sufficient resources to these diverse groups, AI can step in to bridge the gap. By allowing users to
            generate quizzes and receive language feedback from a simple photo of a book page, AI-Quizzer offers an
            innovative solution for learning both the local language and school subjects.</p>

        <p>We believe that AI can provide affordable, accessible support to every child, enabling them to catch up at
            their own pace without anxiety. Our goal is to empower students from all backgrounds to integrate more
            effectively into their new educational environments, breaking down barriers of language and knowledge. With
            AI-Quizzer, we're turning the challenges of adaptation and integration into opportunities for personalized,
            efficient learning.</p>

    <h2>Why AI-Quizzer Stands Out</h2>

    <div class="standout">
        <p>Remember "Mobile First"? That thing that made our thumbs the most important input device? Well, hold onto
            your keyboards (or don't), because AI-Quizzer is ushering in the era of "AI-First" web applications:</p>

        <p><strong>AI-First Approach:</strong> At AI-Quizzer, we've made AI so central to the experience, our servers
            are starting to demand coffee breaks. Here's what we mean:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Content Creation:</strong> Our AI generates quizzes from images faster than you can
                say "machine learning". It's like having a tireless teacher who never needs to sleep (or grade papers).
            </li>

            <li><strong>AI-Powered Evaluation:</strong> Real-time response assessment so quick, you'll wonder if the AI
                is reading your mind. (It's not. Probably.)
            </li>

            <li><strong>Comprehensive Language Feedback:</strong> For language learning, our AI evaluates pronunciation,
                grammar, and content. It's like having a polyglot friend who never gets tired of your mispronunciations.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Voice Integration:</strong> Listen to questions, hear evaluations, and answer with your voice.
                It's so hands-free, you might forget where you put your mouse.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>In fact, AI is so deeply integrated into every aspect of AI-Quizzer, you can go through the entire process -
            from quiz creation to completion - without ever touching your keyboard. It's so AI-centric, we almost
            renamed it to "The Keyboard Retirement Plan". But we stuck with AI-Quizzer. After all, even in an AI-first
            world, we still need to give our future robot overlords something to call us by.</p>
